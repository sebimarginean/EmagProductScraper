# EMAG Web Scraper

This Node.js project is designed as a web scraper for extracting data from websites, potentially focusing on e-commerce platforms like EMAG. It leverages Node.js for server-side logic to programmatically navigate web pages, extract useful information, and possibly store or process this data for analysis or monitoring purposes.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Extraction**: Implements server-side JavaScript to scrape and extract data from web pages, designed to be efficient and effective.
- **Modular Design**: The scraper's functionality is modularized into `functions.js` and scripts within the `executeParts` directory, facilitating easy updates and maintenance.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Includes capabilities for processing and handling extracted data, which can be tailored to meet specific requirements, such as data analysis or alerting on new updates.
- **Node.js Based**: Utilizes the power of Node.js for asynchronous operations, making the scraping process fast and non-blocking.

## Project Structure

- **`server.js`**: Acts as the main entry point for the application. It may also serve as the controller for initiating web scraping tasks.
- **`functions.js` and `executeParts/`**: Contain logic specific to web scraping, such as navigating web pages, extracting data, and handling errors.
- **`public/`**: If the project includes a frontend component, this directory serves static assets to the client-side.
- **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`**: Manage dependencies, ensuring consistency across different setups.
